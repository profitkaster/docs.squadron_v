# âœˆ Welcome to Squadron-V

## **About Us**

We are for peace and friendship of all nations, and our goal is to unite all lovers of aviation. We are a team of engineers working in the field of aircraft engineering.

Our team is active in the creation and development of the P2E project and in embedding utilities into Metaverses.

> Our IRL utilities will be implemented in several Metaverses that will host airlines, airports and terminals. With this implementation, all flights will become available via blockchain.

> Flights will take place in Metaverses and in real life. Our payment and security controls will make it easier to travel the world.

The project Squadron-V is divided into several stages. The first stage is very fast. In the first phase we implement NFT, which will be needed for further travel. The next phases include a Staking, P2E  game, a VR app for creators and developers and App for traveling.

We've put together some helpful guides for you to get setup with our product quickly and easily.
