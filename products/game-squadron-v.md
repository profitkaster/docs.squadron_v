# Game Squadron-V

We are building a game based on **GameFi**. The game type is a card game with aircraft combat.

Playing against AI or another player (**PvE/PvP**), for each victory you will receive an in-game currency ([**SVT Token**](svt-token.md)), which can be exchanged for real money.

Using, acquired in the project **NFT planes**, you get boosts and increased payout ratio. You are waiting for a very beautiful and exciting game.

{% hint style="info" %}
Each NFT aircraft has its own properties.&#x20;

The more unique the Aircraft, the more its possibilities in the game.
{% endhint %}

NFT aircraft are subdivided into squadrons (example [squadron](nft-and-staking/nft-collections.md#the-first-collection)).

Each squadron performs certain functions in the game.

More about the game: **1 quarter of 2023**.
