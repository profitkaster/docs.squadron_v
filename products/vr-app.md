# VR App

The development of aviation requires modern technologies to study the behavior of aircraft in the air.

It is for this reason that we decided to enter into **VR** development to simulate different situations of the behavior of different airplane units.

VR technology will help in the perception of engineers around the world to understand the behavior of different mechanisms and units of aircraft. Thereby reducing the risk and errors in the creation and design of airplane.

Our VR project is very interactive and friendly, which will make it easier to understand the various processes of the behavior of both the airplane as a whole and its systems. This development will reduce errors in airplane design and therefore improve flight safety in general.

Launch: **3 quarter of 2023.**
